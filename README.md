# Okahu agent demo with OpenAI + Langgraph
This repo includes a demo agent application built using OpenAI & Langgraph that is pre-instrumented for observation with Okahu AI Observability cloud. 
You can fork this repo and run the app in Github Codespaces or laptop/desktop to get started quickly.

## Try Okahu with this Agentic app

To try this agent 
- Fork this repo and run in the Github Codespace 
- To run this on Mac 
  - Install python dependencies: ```pip install -r requirement.txt```
- To run this on Windows
  - Install python dependencies: ```pip install -r requirement.txt```

You'll need 
- An OpenAI subscription and an API key to [OpenAI developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/overview)
- An Okahu tenant and API key to [Okahu AI Observability Cloud](https://www.okahu.co)
  - Sign up for Okahu AI accout with your LinkedIn for Github ID
  - Once you login, nagivate to 'Settings' on the left navigation bar and click on 'Generate Okahu API Key'
  - Copy the API key generated and save. Note that you'll not be able to extract that API key after you navigate away from that page.

## Configure the demo environment
- Copy the file agent_env.sh.template to agent_env.sh
- Edit the agent_env.sh file to add the OpenAI API Key and Okahu API key and save

## Run the travel agent app 
This application is an travel agent app that mocks travel related tasks like flight booking, hotel booking and checking weather in a city.
It's is a python program using Langgraph Agent framework. 
The app uses OpenAI gpt-4o model for inference.

1. Source the agent environment
  ```source agent_env.sh```
2. Start the mock weather MCP server
  ```python weather-mcp-server.py > mcp.out 2>&1 &```
3. Verify mcp server is running
  ```cat mcp.out```
  The above command prints content of mpc.out file which should show a message `Application startup complete`
4. Run the pre-instrumented travel agent app with following command
   ```python lc-travel-agent.py```
   The application will prompt you for a travel booking task. You can enter something like `Book a flight from SFO to BOM next week. Book Marriot hotel in central mumbai. Also how't the weather going to be in Mumbai next week?`
   It should responds with successful booking of flight and hotel, as well as weather forcast.
